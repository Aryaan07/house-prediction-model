Author: [Aryan](https://github.com/Aryaan07)


This repository contains a house prediction model trained on the Boston Housing dataset. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to predict housing prices based on various features.

Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset, originally introduced by Harrison and Rubinfeld in 1978, consists of 506 samples and 13 features. Each sample represents a suburb of Boston, and the features include information such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and nitric oxides concentration. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars.

The dataset is widely used in machine learning and serves as a benchmark for regression algorithms. It has been preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

Model
The house prediction model is built using a machine learning algorithm, specifically regression. The model is trained on the Boston Housing dataset to learn the relationships between the input features and the target variable, which is the median value of owner-occupied homes.

To build an accurate prediction model, the following steps were performed:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and split it into training and testing sets.

Model Selection: Several regression algorithms were considered and evaluated based on their performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared score. The chosen algorithm for this model is XYZ regression.

Model Training: The selected algorithm was trained on the training set, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between the input features and target variable.

Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated on the testing set to assess its performance. The evaluation metrics include MSE, R-squared score, and possibly other relevant metrics.

Model Deployment: Once the model demonstrated satisfactory performance, it can be deployed for predicting house prices based on new input data.
Future Improvements
Although the current house prediction model achieves reasonable performance, there are several areas that could be improved:

Feature Engineering: Explore additional feature engineering techniques to create new meaningful features that can enhance the predictive power of the model.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform a thorough search for optimal hyperparameters to fine-tune the model and potentially improve its performance.

Ensemble Methods: Investigate the potential benefits of using ensemble methods, such as random forests or gradient boosting, to further boost the model's predictive capabilities.

Data Expansion: Consider incorporating additional datasets or external data sources that might provide supplementary information and improve the model's accuracy.
